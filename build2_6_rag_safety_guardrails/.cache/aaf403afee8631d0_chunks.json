    "Phoenix Migration PRD (Sample)\n\nObjective\nWe will migrate the legacy “Orion” billing workflow to the new “Phoenix” pipeline to reduce incident load and improve billing correctness. Today, Orion produces frequent reconciliation failures and requires manual intervention.\n\nSuccess Metrics (KPIs)\n1) Billing correctness: reduce reconciliation mismatches by 40% (downward)\n2) Reliability: reduce SEV-1 incidents related to billing by 30% (downward)\n3) Latency: keep end-to-end billing cycle time within +10% of current baseline (flat-ish)\n\nScope\nIn scope:\n- Migrate billing event ingestion to Phoenix\n- Implement parity checks between Orion and Phoenix for 2 release cycles\n- Add monitoring dashboards and alerts for key billing health signals\n\nOut of scope:\n- Pricing model changes\n- UI redesign of the billing console\n- New payment providers",
    "Timeline\nPhase 1 (2 weeks): Shadow mode\n- Phoenix runs in parallel, no customer impact\nExit criteria: parity checks show ≥ 99.5% match for 7 consecutive days\n\nPhase 2 (2 weeks): Gradual rollout\n- 10% → 50% → 100% traffic over 14 days\nExit criteria: error rate does not exceed +0.2% above baseline for 72 hours at each step\n\nPhase 3 (1 week): Decommission Orion\nExit criteria: rollback window passes with no SEV-1 and finance sign-off complete\n\nRollback Policy\nIf billing error rate increases by more than +0.2% above baseline for 2 consecutive hours, rollback traffic to Orion and open a SEV-1 incident. Rollback must be executable within 30 minutes.",
    "Monitoring & Alerting\nMonitor:\n- billing error rate (critical)\n- reconciliation mismatch rate (critical)\n- event ingestion lag (warning)\n- end-to-end cycle time (warning)\nAlerts:\n- Page on-call on critical metric breach\n- Create ticket for warnings with trending analysis\n\nIncidents (Definitions)\nSEV-1: customer billing impact or data correctness breach requiring immediate attention.\nSEV-1 SLA: acknowledge within 10 minutes, mitigation started within 30 minutes.\n\nData Retention\nBilling events in Phoenix are retained for 180 days. Aggregated billing summaries retained for 2 years.\n\nStakeholders & Escalation\nOwner: Product Manager (Billing)\nEngineering lead: Backend lead (Phoenix)\nFinance approver: Finance operations manager\nEscalation path: On-call engineer → Eng lead → PM → Director",
    "Risks & Mitigations\nRisk 1: Phoenix ingestion backlog under peak load\nMitigation: load testing + autoscaling policies before Phase 2\n\nRisk 2: Parity checks create noisy false positives\nMitigation: define thresholds and sampling strategy; review weekly with Finance\n\nDependency / Potential blocker\nA required schema change in upstream “Atlas” events must be shipped before Phase 2 to avoid data loss. De-risk via early integration testing in Phase 1.\n\nCost / Budget Constraint\nAvoid increasing infra cost by more than 15% during rollout. If exceeded, reduce parallelization window or optimize ingestion batching.\n\nGo / No-Go Checklist\n- Parity checks ≥ 99.5% for 7 days\n- Rollback tested and verified < 30 minutes\n- Critical alerts paging correctly\n- Finance sign-off\n- On-call runbook updated"
