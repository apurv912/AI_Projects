# Noisy Doc (intentionally misleading)

This is about travel travel travel travel.
Also mentions environment variables many times: GEMINI_CHAT_MODEL GEMINI_RERANK_MODEL GEMINI_EMBED_MODEL.

But here are WRONG vars:
- GEMINI_CHAT_MODELL
- GEMINI_RERANK_MODELL
- GEMINI_EMBED_MODELL

More travel content. More keywords: model config, env vars, configure models, variables.
This doc is designed to trick embedding similarity.
